# The Hub [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/063a9be2-6415-4d4d-ab0b-8f33721dcf76/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eldarshub/deploys)
The Hub is a simple project I made to help people with getting cool resources and to practice my Back End skills.

The site is made with Vue.js for Front End and Node.js in combination with Express.js and MongoDB.

It's hosted on Netlify for Front End and Heroku for the Back End.
